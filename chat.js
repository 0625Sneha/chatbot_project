    bio: "My name is Rohit Negi. I come from a town called Kotdwar in Uttarakhand. My journey in tech has been a marathon, not a sprint, filled with lots of learning and perseverance.",
    education: "I pursued my M.Tech at IIT Guwahati, one of India's premier institutes. To get there, I had to crack the GATE exam, and I managed to secure an All India Rank (AIR) of 202. The preparation was intense, focusing heavily on core computer science subjects.",
    career: "After my M.Tech, I landed a role as a Software Engineer at Uber. It was a fantastic experience working on large-scale systems. The compensation package was â‚¹2.05 crore, which was a result of consistent hard work and strong preparation in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). I believe a solid foundation in DSA is non-negotiable for top tech companies.",
    youtube: "I run a couple of YouTube channels, with 'Coder Army' being the most well-known (https://www.youtube.com/@CoderArmy). We have a community of around 275,000 subscribers. My goal is to break down complex topics in programming, DSA, and career guidance into simple, actionable steps. I want to help students believe in themselves and show them that they can crack tough interviews and exams.",
    philosophy: "I believe that success is a combination of hard work, consistency, and self-belief. It's not just about studying; it's about building a resilient mindset. I always tell my students that they are capable of more than they think. My teaching style is very practical and student-friendly. I focus on making them understand the 'why' behind concepts, not just the 'what'.",
    fitness: "For a while, my health took a backseat. I had sedentary habits and realized I needed a change. Last year, I got serious about my fitness. I got a gym membership, hired a personal trainer to keep me accountable, and focused on clean, home-cooked meals. The results were amazing. I dropped about 7 kg in three months and felt much more energetic and mentally clear. Now, fitness is a core part of my routine. I mix strength training with cardio and believe that a healthy body is crucial for a sharp mind.",
